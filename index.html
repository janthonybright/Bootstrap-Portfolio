      My name is Joey Bright, I am a new fullstack developer from the University of Utah fullstack program. I have
      worked in the Film industry for the past 12 years as a Location Manager and Location Scout. Doing logistics and coordinating film projects from start to finish.
      This kind of work involves high levels of stress and very strict time frames, that has taught me strong interpersonal skills and working with a team.
    </p>
   <p class="text-light float-md-right">When I am not working I play video games, rock climb, and skateboard. I like to try new things and eat new foods, especially if they are spicy foods.
    My loving and supportive wife and I have been married for 2 years. We live in North Salt Lake with our two dogs Finn and Peanut, that love to have adventurous hikes.
    I am currently working on my coding skills in the Boot Camp and any freelance film projects that fit inbetween.
